Production Monitoring & Future Improvements
Recommended Monitoring Approach
For a production environment, the following monitoring strategies are recommended:

Logs Aggregation: Use a service like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Datadog, or CloudWatch Logs to collect and analyze logs.

Metrics Collection: Expose metrics via Prometheus and visualize with Grafana.

Alerting: Slack integration for critical failures (all providers down, blocks stopped flowing). Tiered Alerts: Warning (1 provider down) → Critical (multiple providers down) → Emergency (service stopped)

Health Endpoint: Add a dedicated HTTP endpoint to expose service health information.

Key Metrics to Track
Block Processing:

Blocks processed per minute
Missing blocks count
Block processing latency
Provider Health:

Response times per provider
Error rates per provider
Provider switching frequency
Time spent on each provider
System Health:

CPU/Memory usage
Network I/O
Error rates by type
Future Improvements
Given ample time to build, these improvements would enhance the solution:

Background task to probe idle providers every 10-30 s to keep fresh health scores and avoid switching to another bad node

Utilize the async await design for better concurrency in more areas in the app (e.g. processing blocks).

Advanced Provider Metrics: More sophisticated health scoring based on historical performance.

Provider Backends: Support for more blockchain networks and providers.

Circuit Breaker Pattern: Implement circuit breakers to prevent overwhelming failing providers.

Use a message queue to decouple block fetching from processing.

Scaling: Support for distributed instances with leader election.

Load Balancing: Distribute requests across multiple endpoints of the same provider.

Caching Layer: Cache recent blocks to reduce API calls.

Chaos-test harness (kill provider pods, inject 500s) in CI.

Persistence Layer: Store block data in a database for historical analysis and to prevent data loss during restarts.
